# TASK MANAGER APP

## Introduction
Task Manager CLI application is a Python-based command-line tool integrated with SQLAlchemy for efficient task management.

## Problem Statement
In the fast-paced world, managing tasks efficiently is crucial for personal and professional productivity. To address this need, we aim to develop a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks seamlessly.

## Solution
The Task Manager CLI application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently through a command-line interface. Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks, ensuring better organization and productivity. This is an application where:

- Users can create tasks by providing a title, description, and due date.
- Display a list of all tasks with relevant details such as title and due date.
- Users can modify task details, including title, description, and due date.
- Ability to delete tasks individually.

## Minimum Viable Product
1. Create a task.
2. Update a task.
3. Delete a task.
4. Display all tasks.

## Technologies Used
1. Python: Programming language for application logic.
2. SQLAlchemy: ORM for interaction with the SQLite database.
3. SQLite: Database for storing task information.
4. Typer: Library for building command-line interfaces.
5. Rich: for colorized terminal output.

## Setting Up
1. Run `pipenv install` then `pipenv shell` inside the directory of the app.
2. Navigate into the `lib` folder.
3. Execute the file using `python3 todocli.py <command>`.

## Examples
1. To show a list of tasks, run `python3 todocli.py show`.
2. To add a task, run `python3 todocli.py add {title} {description} {category_id} {tag_id}`.
3. To update an existing task, run `python3 todocli.py update {task_id} --description (what to change)`.
4. To delete any tasks, run `python3 todocli.py delete {task_id}`.
5. To filter tasks, run `python3 todocli.py filter {tag_id}`.
