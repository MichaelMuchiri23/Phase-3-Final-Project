TASK MANAGER APP
Introduction
Task Manager CLI application, a Python-based command-line tool integrated with SQLAlchemy 
for efficient task management.

Problem Statement:
In the fast-paced world, managing tasks efficiently is crucial for personal and professional 
productivity. To address this need, we aim to develop a Command-Line Interface (CLI) 
application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks seamlessly.

Solution:
The Task Manager CLI application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently 
through a command-line interface. Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks, ensuring 
better organization and productivity.
This is an application where:
• Users can create tasks by providing a title, description and due date.
• Display a list of all tasks with relevant details such as title and due date.
• Users can modify task details, including title, description and due date.
• Ability to delete tasks individually.

Minimum Viable Product:
1. Create a task.
2. Update a task
3. Delete a task.
4. Display all tasks.
Technologies used:
1. Python: Programming language for application logic.
2. SQLAlchemy: ORM for interaction with the SQLite database.
3. SQLite: Database for storing task information.
4. Typer: Library for building command-line interfaces.
5. Rich: for a colorized terminal output.
